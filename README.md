# OfficeBooker

## Kryptos Kode - Office Booker - Project Description
Office Booker is a program designed to help employees with booking desk space and meeting rooms for a specific date in their office. Many companies have downscaled their office space so therefore not every employee can be in the office at once. Office Booker provides a reliable way to book space for employees to work at their office.
